# Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) Programs

This repository contains Python implementations of various algorithms covered in the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** course. These programs focus on algorithmic problem-solving techniques, complexity analysis, and optimization.

## ðŸ“– Introduction
The Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) is an essential subject in computer science that focuses on different algorithmic approaches, including:
- **Divide and Conquer**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Backtracking**
- **Graph Algorithms**
- **NP-Completeness**

This repository serves as a resource for students and developers to understand these algorithms through practical coding examples.
